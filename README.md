# Beacon Application "Laser Cutting Machine"

The Beacon Application "Laser Cutting Machine" is a sandbox application that demonstrates the creation of a virtual reality training scenario (maintenance tasks of a machine) through the use of the Enabler "INTERACT". With the application, the user is taught how to clean an industrial laser cutting machine in a step by step process and also validated with a score in the end. The application also illustrates the numerous possibilities such as creating interaction with objects, ease of configuring a scenario, visual effects to the machine etc 

## Dependencies

Executable: the built application requires a VR-Ready PC on Windows with SteamVR installed, up-to-date drivers, and a PC VR headset.
Unity Project: this Beacon Application project requires Unity the 3D engine, and the Enabler "INTERACT" as a plugin to Unity.

## HARDWARE Prerequisites
A fairly recent VR-ready laptop or desktop computer running Windows 10/11
A Meta Quest 2 VR headset and its Touch controllers
(if any other SteamVR compatible headset is used, please disregard each step about Oculus / Meta specific installations)
An Oculus Link cable (or any compatible USB-C cable with enough bandwidth).

## SOFTWARE Prerequisites
Install SteamVR. An offline version (which doesn’t require a Steam account) is proposed.
For Meta headsets: install the Oculus Application, and connect with your Oculus / Meta account. The same account should be used on the computer AND on the VR headset.
ROOM SPACE : if possible have a free space of 4x4 m². Less is possible, but less comfortable.

## Installation and Launch

(if Meta headset is used) On the computer : launch the “Oculus” application. If not done already, log in with your Oculus / Meta account.
Plug the Oculus Link cable to your Headset, then to the computer.
In the VR headset, open the “Quick Settings” by clicking on the clock on the main menu bar
Then, click on “Quest Link / Rift” button, then “Start”. After a short loading time, you should find yourself in a white virtual environment, with a different menu layout.

(Back on the computer, if not done already : Unzip “DemoLaserCutter_XR2Learn.zip”
Then launch "Demo XR2Learn Laser.exe".

Put the VR headset back on, and take the Touch controllers. You should be able to see a virtual room with a laser cutting machine, and see the hands of your virtual avatar moving with the controllers.
